##List Operations in Python##

This script demonstrates basic list operations in Python, showcasing how to create, modify, and retrieve information from lists.

📜 Overview

The program performs the following steps:

Create an empty list called my_list.

Append elements (10, 20, 30, 40) to the list.

Insert a value (15) at a specific position.

Extend the list with another list: [50, 60, 70].

Remove the last element from the list.

Sort the list in ascending order.

Find and print the index of a specific value (30).

🛠 How It Works

Appending adds elements to the end of the list.

Inserting places an element at a specific index without overwriting existing elements.

Extending adds multiple elements from another list.

Deleting with del removes elements by index.

Sorting arranges the list in ascending order by default.

Indexing returns the position of a given value.

▶️ Running the Script

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended), then run:

[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

Index of 30 is: 3
